### Gabriela Font

by Eduardo Tunni


Gabriela is a serif typeface with soft shapes, and special terminal forms which are shaped like curls. They connect each letter to create attractive word shapes and text blocks with a fine texture. In small bodies of text she works well for reading, and in headlines provides interesting details to catch the eye.

Updated in June 2013 with support for Cyrillic.
